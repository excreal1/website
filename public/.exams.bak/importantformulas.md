### Important Formulas and Examples in Inferential Statistics

1. **Population Mean (μ) Formula**:
   - The population mean, denoted by μ, is the average of all values in a population.
   - Formula: ``` μ = ΣX / N ```, where ΣX represents the sum of all values in the population, and N is the population size.

   **Example**: Let's say we have a population of exam scores: {85, 90, 92, 88, 95}. The population mean is calculated as:
   ``` μ = (85 + 90 + 92 + 88 + 95) / 5 = 90 ```

2. **Sample Mean (x̄) Formula**:
   - The sample mean, denoted by x̄, is the average of all values in a sample.
   - Formula: ``` x̄ = Σx / n ```, where Σx represents the sum of all values in the sample, and n is the sample size.

   **Example**: Suppose we take a sample of exam scores: {85, 90, 92}. The sample mean is calculated as:
   ``` x̄ = (85 + 90 + 92) / 3 ≈ 89 ```

3. **Population Variance (σ²) Formula**:
   - The population variance, denoted by σ², measures the dispersion of values in a population from the population mean.
   - Formula: ``` σ² = Σ(X - μ)² / N ```, where X represents each value in the population, μ is the population mean, and N is the population size.

   **Example**: Using the same population of exam scores, we calculate the population variance as:
   ``` σ² = [(85 - 90)² + (90 - 90)² + (92 - 90)² + (88 - 90)² + (95 - 90)²] / 5 = 11.6 ```

4. **Sample Variance (s²) Formula**:
   - The sample variance, denoted by s², is an estimate of the population variance based on a sample.
   - Formula: ``` s² = Σ(x - x̄)² / (n - 1) ```, where x̄ is the sample mean, x represents each value in the sample, and n is the sample size.

   **Example**: Using the sample of exam scores {85, 90, 92}, we calculate the sample variance as:
   ``` s² = [(85 - 89)² + (90 - 89)² + (92 - 89)²] / (3 - 1) = 13 ```
