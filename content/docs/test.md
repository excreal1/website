# Inferential Statistics
## Start with:

### Probability Distributions:

- Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment.
- Common distributions include the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve), binomial distribution (for binary outcomes), and t-distribution (similar to the normal distribution but used for smaller sample sizes).

### Sampling Methods:

- Sampling methods involve selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population.
Random sampling ensures each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
- Other methods include stratified sampling (dividing the population into subgroups and then randomly sampling from each subgroup) and cluster sampling (dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting clusters for sampling).

### Hypothesis Testing:

- Hypothesis testing is a method for making inferences about a population based on sample data.

- It involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), collecting sample data, and using statistical tests to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
- Common tests include z-test and t-test for means, chi-square test for independence, and F-test for variances.

### Confidence Intervals:

- Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie.
- The width of the confidence interval depends on the level of confidence chosen (e.g., 95% confidence interval).
Parametric Tests:

- Parametric tests assume that the data follow a specific 

### probability distribution.
  - Examples include t-tests for comparing means of two groups and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for comparing means of more than two groups.

### Non-parametric Tests:

- Non-parametric tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of the data.
- They are used when data do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests.
- Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing two independent samples and the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparing more than two independent samples.

#### Regression Analysis:

- Regression analysis examines the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.
Simple linear regression involves one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables.

#### Correlation Analysis:

- Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- Pearson correlation coefficient is used for continuous variables with a linear relationship, while Spearman correlation coefficient is used for ordinal or non-normally distributed data.
